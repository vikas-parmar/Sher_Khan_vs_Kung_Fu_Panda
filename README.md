# [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://github.com/vikas-parmar/tic-tac-toe/) 

## Description
:pushpin: Tic tac toe is a web application that allows users to play the classic game of tic tac toe in a user-friendly interface. The game is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it utilizes modern web development technologies such as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. <br />
Users can play the game by clicking on a square on 3x3 grid, and the app keeps track of the current player and updates the board accordingly. The game ends when one player gets three in a row or when the board is full with no winner, and the app displays a message to indicate the result. :zap:
